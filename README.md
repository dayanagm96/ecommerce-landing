# D-Fragrance
This was one of the first projects I made when I was starting to learn web developing.

I tried my best to add my own personal touch when I was following a tutorial for creating an e-commerce website on YouTube. Even though I know it's not perfect, I decided that since it was one of my first projects, I didn't want to make any modifications. This page was created with HTML, CSS and a bit of JavaScript for the toggle menu button. This page is 100% responsive.

I decided to create a landing page for an online fragrance store for everyone, showing the classy style that we can find when referring to perfume itself. I added my own style choosing to go for pastel colors and minimalistic style, mainly black and white for details, although I added some other details with stronger colors.

Fun fact: I learned a lot about fragrances and perfumes while making this.
